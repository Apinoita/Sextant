# Sextant
The sextant mod is a small mod that adds a sextant so you can measure angles.

This mod is originally meant to be used with a mod that disables the F3 overlay (for example [no f3](https://modrinth.com/datapack/no-f3)) because the angle shown in the overlay makes this mod a lot less useful.

## Wiki
### Measuring
Measuring is done by right-clicking with the sextant.
The latest measurement of the sextant can be seen in the tooltip of the sextant

### attachments
The tooltip tells what attachments are equipped at the moment.
Attachments can be inserted into the sextant by putting them into the first slot in the hotbar and right-clicking while sneaking.
Attachments can be outputted by not having anything in the first slot and right-clicking while sneaking.
There are two possible attachments:
The spyglass makes the sextants zoom bigger and increases accuracy.
The compass makes the camera snap to the cardinal directions (sensitivity can be configured) and shows which way you are looking.
